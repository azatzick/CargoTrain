# CargoTrain
This project exemplifies a cargo train, carring sorted cargo through various destinations. The project is a java written implementation, primarily using linked-lists to store objects. 
The train itself stores cargo objects, which all have a particular destination attribute. 


This project uses a linked list to load and unload a theoretical train, sorting objects into cities and cargo Types along the way
